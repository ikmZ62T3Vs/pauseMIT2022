 #How to run this flask project

#Work in your terminal and navigate to the pauseMIT directory

#We need flask, and the way the internet says to run it without messing with your machine is to activate a virtual environment. 

source env/bin/activate


#we need to download the packages so make sure your pip install works and download flask

python3 -m pip install Flask


#Now we need to go to where we actually create a flask object in python, so navigate to the app directory


export FLASK_APP= \_\_init\_\_.py

#from now on to check how things are going just  type
flask run

#enter http address in chrome , CTRL + C to quit.
